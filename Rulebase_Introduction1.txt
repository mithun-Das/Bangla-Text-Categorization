                                          Rule-based production system

A rule-based production system consists of three basic component: set of rules, a database, and an interpreter for the rules.
Rules are the ordered pair of symbol strings, with a left hand side and a right hand side. The rule set has a predetermined 
total ordering and database is the simply collection of symbols. The interpreter scans the LHS of  each rule until any match
is found in the database. Symbols matched in the data base  are replaced by thos in the RHS in the rule and then scanning either
continues with the next rule or start from first.
